# anna-portfolio-page

This is a portfolio page created in `HTML and CSS`. The code had been written from the scratch in `VS Code` program. The purpose of this project is to introduce myself and the projects I have done. The page also features links with contact information.


## User Story
```
I AM a student 
WHO needs a portfolio of work 
SO THAT I can showcase my skills and talents to potential employers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
